# Commit

> Create atomic git commits using a four-pass methodology that separates content decisions from formatting standards.

## Skill documents

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) | Overview, commit format reference, atomicity rules |
| [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) | Four-pass execution sequence |
| [references/chris-beams-commit-style.md](references/chris-beams-commit-style.md) | The 7 rules our format is built on |

---

## When to use

- User asks to commit staged or unstaged changes
- User runs `/commit`
- Changes are ready and the user explicitly requests a commit

## When NOT to use

- User is exploring changes or running `git diff`
- No changes exist to commit
- User has not explicitly asked for a commit

---

## Quick reference

<mark>**One logical change per commit. Separate concerns across four passes: content, standards, final review, post-commit verification.**</mark>

---

## Required reading

Read before executing:

1. `.claude/docs/patterns/git/atomic-git-commits.md` — the full atomic commit methodology and Conventional Commits standard

---

## Key principles

| Principle | What it means |
|:----------|:-------------|
| Atomic | One complete logical change per commit — not by size, by coherence |
| Imperative mood | "Add feature" not "Added feature" — completes "If applied, this commit will..." |
| WHY not what | Body explains the reasoning, not just a list of files |
| Working state | All tests pass after the commit |
| Selective staging | Stage files per logical change, not everything at once |

### Test-driven commits

Every commit should pass all tests:

1. Write failing tests for new functionality
2. Implement the feature
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Commit the complete change

This ensures each commit represents a working state of the codebase.

---

## The coherence test

> If you removed any file from this commit, would the remaining files still represent the same complete logical change?

- If removing a file leaves a hole → it belongs
- If removing a file leaves a perfectly coherent commit → it does not belong

### The "and" test

<mark>**If your commit message contains "and", you probably have two commits.**</mark> "Add login validation **and** fix header styling" is two changes wearing a trench coat. If you can't describe the commit without "and", split it.

---

## The atomicity balance

Atomicity has two failure modes, not one. Use [clarity through opposites](../../../docs/research/ai-patterns/clarity-through-opposites.md) to find the sweet spot:

**Over-atomising** (too many commits):
- Splitting a one-line CSS fix and a related prop addition into separate commits
- Committing a function rename separately from updating its callers
- One commit per file when all files serve the same change

**Under-atomising** (too few commits):
- Lumping a bug fix, a new feature, and a formatting cleanup into one commit
- Committing everything changed in a session as a single commit
- Mixing unrelated changes that happened to touch the same area

**The sweet spot**: all changes share a common purpose that you can explain in one sentence. If removing any change leaves a hole, it belongs. If adding another change would require a second explanation, it doesn't.

**The test**: look in both directions. Ask "am I grouping unrelated things?" (under-atomising) AND "am I splitting apart things that need each other?" (over-atomising). When neither question raises a flag, you've found the right granularity.

---

## Common AI atomicity mistakes

<mark>**These are not valid reasons for combining changes into one commit:**</mark>

- **Modified in the same session** — files changed during one conversation are not automatically one atomic commit
- **Sharing a prefix** — using `docs:` on two unrelated documentation changes does not make them atomic
- **Requested as one task** — "update the docs and fix the bug" is two tasks and two commits
- **Touching the same area** — editing three files in `src/auth/` for different reasons is three commits
- **"While I was in there" changes** — noticing a typo while fixing a bug does not make the typo part of the bug fix
- **Produced by the same tool** — a test survey flags 3 files that need tests. Each test suite is its own commit. They share a prefix (`test:`) and came from the same analysis, but removing one leaves the others perfectly coherent
- **Same change in different places** — applying the same refactor to two independent directories is two commits, not one. Each stands alone — either could be reverted without breaking the other
- **Tests for pre-existing code** — <mark>**did the production code exist before this session?**</mark> If yes, tests are a separate `test:` commit. If no (new class + its test file), they belong together

**Example of mixed changes that should be separated**:

```bash
# BAD: Two different logical changes in one commit
git add TODO.md docs/research/ai-coding/what-is-a-frame.md
# This mixes: project management (TODO) + documentation (frame concept)

# GOOD: Separate atomic commits
git add TODO.md
.claude/hooks/do_commit.sh -m "build: Add TODO.md with AI frame loading system entry"

git add docs/research/ai-coding/what-is-a-frame.md
.claude/hooks/do_commit.sh -m "docs: Create comprehensive frame concept documentation"
```

## Intent before diff

<mark>**"What is the user trying to accomplish?"** — ask this before looking at the diff.</mark>

The diff tells you *what changed*. The user's intent tells you *why*. AI consistently writes commit messages that describe the mechanics of the diff ("fix image paths", "rename directory") rather than the purpose ("add PDF export with embedded images"). The commit log should read like a story of what was accomplished, not a changelog of file operations.

## Content focus blindness

Both people and AI consistently miss formatting standards while focused on content logic. The four-pass approach solves this by making standards verification a dedicated step (Pass 2) separate from content decisions (Pass 1).

---

## Commit message format

```text
<type>: <Subject line — 50 chars max>

<Body explaining WHY — wrap at 72 chars>

- Bullet points for specific changes
```

### Standard prefixes

| Prefix | Use for |
|:-------|:--------|
| `feat:` | New features or functionality |
| `fix:` | Bug fixes and corrections |
| `docs:` | Documentation only changes |
| `refactor:` | Code restructuring without changing behaviour |
| `style:` | Formatting, white-space changes |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build:` | Build system or dependency changes |
| `chore:` | Maintenance tasks |
| `perf:` | Performance improvements |
| `ci:` | CI configuration changes |

### Subject line rules

- Standard prefix, lowercase (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`)
- Capitalize first word after colon ("Add" not "add")
- Imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- No period at end
- Under 50 characters total

### Body rules

- Blank line after subject
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain WHY, not just what
- Start with explanatory paragraph before bullets
- Add warmth — show care for users and future developers

### Example

```text
fix: Fix null pointer in payment validation

When users had incomplete billing data, validation would crash
instead of showing helpful errors. This adds proper null checks
and returns meaningful validation messages.

- Add null checks for all required fields
- Return validation errors instead of exceptions
- Include tests for edge cases with missing data
```

## The pre-commit atomicity trap

Pre-commit hooks can accidentally cause you to commit multiple unrelated files together:

1. You stage one file: `git add file1.js`
2. You run `git commit` and hooks fix OTHER files
3. You run `git add -A` to include the fixes
4. **Result**: your commit now includes unrelated files

**Prevention**: Run the repo's hooks manually in Pass 0 (see [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)). This fixes all formatting upfront so hooks have nothing to fix during the actual commit.

## What atomic commits afford

> Not what a commit *is* — what it makes possible.

Atomic commits aren't just a discipline. They're a position that creates possibilities that don't exist when changes are lumped together:

| Affordance | What becomes possible |
|:-----------|:----------------------|
| **Automatic changelog** | Typed prefixes + clear subjects let tooling generate changelogs mechanically — no human curation required |
| **Narrative arc** | The commit log reads like a story of the journey — what was built, why, in what order. Future developers inherit *context*, not just code |
| **Independent revertibility** | Any commit can be undone without collateral damage — you remove one idea, not a tangle of ideas |
| **Bisectability** | `git bisect` works because every commit is a working state — the bug hides in exactly one commit, not somewhere across a session dump |
| **Review in logical steps** | Reviewers follow the author's reasoning one thought at a time, instead of reverse-engineering intent from a wall of diffs |
| **Cherry-picking** | Individual changes move cleanly between branches — a fix doesn't drag an unrelated feature along for the ride |
| **Blame that explains** | `git blame` points to a commit that says *why*, not a grab-bag that says "various changes" |

<mark>Before atomic commits, these possibilities don't exist. After, they're available whether you use them or not — that's what makes them affordances, not features.</mark>

---

## The governing principle

> Make each commit a gift to your future self — one complete idea, clearly explained, independently revertible.
