| 1 | **Read** the skill | [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) |
| 2 | **Prepare** session | [PREPARE.md](PREPARE.md) |

| 5 | **Match** to Linear issues | Phase 2 below |
| 6 | **Review** the match report | Human review |
| 7 | **Upsert** Linear | Phase 3 below |
| 8 | **Migrate images** | Phase 4 below |
| 9 | **Verify** migration | Phase 5 below |

## Phase 1: Export

**Goal**: Pull every card from every list on the Trello board, including descriptions, comments, and checklists.

1. **Clear the output directory** — remove stale data from previous runs before exporting

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/trello-export && mkdir -p /tmp/trello-export
```

2. Get the Trello board ID — if the user gives a name, resolve it via `mcp__trello__list_boards` and filter by name
3. Run `export_trello.py` with board ID and output directory
3. Verify: check `SUMMARY.md` in the output directory for card counts

```bash
python scripts/export_trello.py --board-id <BOARD_ID> --output /tmp/trello-export
cat /tmp/trello-export/SUMMARY.md
```

**Output**: One JSON file per list + `SUMMARY.md` + `all_cards.json`

---

## Phase 1.5: Verify Linear project

**Goal**: Confirm the target Linear project exists and is not trashed before fetching issues or matching.

1. Call `mcp__linear-*__list_projects` with the project name and `includeArchived: true`
2. Check the results — if **no project** is returned, or **all matches are trashed**, stop and tell the user
3. If a valid (non-trashed) project exists, proceed to Phase 2

<mark>**Why this matters**: Linear's `list_issues` returns issues from trashed projects. Without this check, the match phase silently matches against ghost data and reports everything as "skip" — hiding the fact that there's nothing to match against.</mark>

---

## Phase 2: Match

**Goal**: Match Trello cards to Linear issues by title, producing a match report for human review.

1. Export Linear issues from the verified project to a JSON file (paginate if > 250)
2. Run `match.py` with the Trello export directory and the Linear issues file
3. Review `match-report.json` — check unmatched cards and fuzzy matches

```bash
python scripts/match.py --trello-dir /tmp/trello-export --linear-file /tmp/linear-issues.json
```

**Output**: `match-report.json` with actions: `update`, `skip`, `no_match`

### Reviewing the match report

- **`update`** — Trello has content, Linear issue is empty. Description and comments will be pushed
- **`create`** — Trello card has no matching Linear issue. A new issue will be created
- **`skip`** — Linear issue already has a description. No action
- **`fuzzy`** — title matched approximately, not exactly. Verify the match is correct

---

## Phase 3: Update

**Goal**: Upsert Trello content into Linear — update existing issues, create missing ones.

1. Dry-run first — shows what would change without touching Linear
2. Review the dry-run output
3. Apply when satisfied

```bash
# Dry-run — writes inspection payloads to /tmp/trello-export/cards/
python scripts/update_linear.py --match-report /tmp/trello-export/match-report.json --team Wordtracker --project "What's next (archive)" --dry-run

# Apply — calls Linear directly via tools/linear_client.py
python scripts/update_linear.py --match-report /tmp/trello-export/match-report.json --api-key-env LINEAR_WORDTRACKER_API_KEY --team Wordtracker --project "What's next (archive)" --apply
```

In **dry-run** mode, `update_linear.py` writes one JSON payload per card to `cards/` next to the match report (e.g. `000.json`, `001.json`). These are for human inspection — review them before running `--apply`.

In **apply** mode, the script calls Linear directly via `tools/linear_client.py` — resolving team, project, and state IDs up front, then calling `update_issue` / `create_issue` for each entry. No agent round-trip, no `cards/` artefacts. `--api-key-env` is required in this mode.

---

## Phase 4: Migrate images

**Goal**: Download Trello image attachments and re-upload inline to Linear issue descriptions.

Trello attachment URLs require OAuth authentication. The script downloads each image from Trello, uploads it to Linear via the `fileUpload` mutation, and embeds it inline in the issue description.

Two scripts handle different image sources:

1. **Description images** — images already referenced in the description (broken `uploads.linear.app` URLs from the initial migration):

```bash
# Dry-run
python /tmp/migrate_trello_images.py \
  --project "<PROJECT>" \
  --trello-data /tmp/trello-export/all_cards.json \
  --dry-run

# Apply
python /tmp/migrate_trello_images.py \
  --project "<PROJECT>" \
  --trello-data /tmp/trello-export/all_cards.json
```

2. **Card attachments** — standalone image attachments on Trello cards that need embedding inline:

```bash
# Dry-run
python /tmp/migrate_trello_attachments.py \
  --project "<PROJECT>" \
  --dry-run

# Apply
python /tmp/migrate_trello_attachments.py \
  --project "<PROJECT>"
```

---

## Phase 5: Verify

**Goal**: Confirm every Trello card landed in Linear with correct title, description, comments, and images.

The verify script fetches every Linear issue individually (to get full descriptions, not truncated), then compares against the Trello export across four dimensions.

```bash
cd .claude/skills/trello-to-linear

python scripts/verify.py \
  --target-api-key-env <TARGET_API_KEY_ENV> \
  --target-project "<PROJECT>" \
  --export-dir /tmp/trello-export
```

**Checks**:

- **Titles** — every Trello card has a matching Linear issue
- **Descriptions** — Trello description text appears in Linear
- **Comments** — verbatim comment count matches (author + date format)
- **Images** — Trello image attachments appear inline in Linear

To auto-fix truncated descriptions and missing comments:

```bash
python scripts/verify.py \
  --target-api-key-env <TARGET_API_KEY_ENV> \
  --target-project "<PROJECT>" \
  --export-dir /tmp/trello-export \
  --fix
```

## Stopping rules

- All `update` items in the match report have been pushed to Linear
- All `create` items have been created in Linear
- Images migrated and rendering in Linear
- `verify.py` passes on all four dimensions
- Summary written to `UPDATE-SUMMARY.md`

---

## Verification

- [ ] Export produced JSON files for all lists on the board
- [ ] Linear project verified as existing and not trashed
- [ ] Match report reviewed — fuzzy matches verified, creates confirmed
- [ ] Dry-run output reviewed before applying
- [ ] `update_linear.py` run — all issues created/updated
- [ ] Image migration run — description images and card attachments uploaded
- [ ] `verify.py` passes — titles, descriptions, comments, and images all correct
- [ ] Spot-checked image rendering in target issues
- [ ] `UPDATE-SUMMARY.md` written with final counts
