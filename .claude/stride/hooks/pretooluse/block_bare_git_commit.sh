# All commits must go through the /commit skill, which uses

# The hook only sees the top-level Bash command, so the wrapper
# script's internal git commit is invisible to it.

# Receives JSON on stdin with tool_input.command. Exits 0 to allow,

BLOCKED: bare "git commit" is not allowed.

You MUST invoke the /commit skill using the Skill tool before committing.
Do not call do_commit.sh directly — follow the four-pass workflow first.
