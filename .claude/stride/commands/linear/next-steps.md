# Review priorities and recommend next work

Review what's happening and recommend what to work on next.

## Decision rules

- **Priority ordering**: build failure > PRs needing fix > in-progress work > PRs needing review > approved PRs to merge > backlog
- If there are started issues assigned to the current user, treat these as the primary tasks
- Do not recommend new work unless current tasks are blocked or completed
- Sort backlog candidates by priority: Urgent > High > Medium > Low
- Prefer quick wins when priorities are equal (small, self-contained issues)
- Treat issues with dependencies, blocker labels, or blocked status as blocked
- Flag blocked issues but do not recommend them
- Recommend 1–3 concrete next actions, not a full backlog dump

## Steps

### 0. Resolve project

Check for a `.linear_project` file in the repository root.

- If **found**: read the project name from it
- If **not found**: list available projects via `list_projects`, ask the user to choose, and save their selection to `.linear_project`. Then check the repo's `.gitignore` — if `.linear_project` isn't listed, append it.

Use the resolved project name for all Linear API calls in this command.

### 1. Fetch data (all calls in parallel)

| Call | Tool |
|:-----|:-----|
| `get_user` — authenticated user | Linear MCP |
| `list_issues` — state: `started`, project: resolved project | Linear MCP |
| `list_issues` — state: `unstarted`, project: resolved project | Linear MCP |
| `list_issues` — state: `backlog`, project: resolved project | Linear MCP |
| `list_issues` — state: `completed`, updatedAt: `-P7D`, project: resolved project | Linear MCP |
| `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,author,reviewDecision,reviews,url` | Bash |

### 2. Show current work

If there are started issues, show them first — they provide context for what's already happening.

| ID | Title | Assignee | Priority |
|:---|:------|:---------|:---------|

If none: "Nothing currently in progress."

### 3. Open pull requests

If there are open PRs, show them:

| PR | Title | Branch | Review | Action |
|:---|:------|:-------|:-------|:-------|

For each PR, check for unaddressed review feedback:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/reviews --jq '[.[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED")] | length'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments --jq 'length'
```

Classify each PR:

- **Needs fix** — has `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or unresolved review comments → recommend `/fix <issue-id>`
- **Needs review** — `reviewDecision` is not `APPROVED` and no feedback yet → waiting on reviewers
- **Approved** — ready to merge → recommend `/finish <issue-id>`

PRs needing fix take priority over all new backlog work.

If none: "No open pull requests."

### 4. Recently completed (last 7 days)

| ID | Title | Completed |
|:---|:------|:----------|

If none: "No issues completed recently."

This context should influence recommendations — prefer follow-up issues or related tasks where appropriate.

### 5. Build candidate list

Combine `unstarted` and `backlog` issues into a single candidate list. Exclude issues already in `started`. Exclude issues identified as blocked. Sort by priority (Urgent first).

Show as a table:

| ID | Title | Priority | Labels | Status |
|:---|:------|:---------|:-------|:-------|

If the list is empty: "Backlog is empty — nothing to recommend."

### 6. Recommend next actions

Apply the priority ordering: build failure > PRs needing fix > in-progress > PRs needing review > approved PRs to merge > backlog.

Pick 1–3 items. For each recommendation, explain briefly why it's the right next move using factors such as: priority, quick win potential, follow-up to recently completed work, unblocking other work, PR needing review, alignment with current work in progress.

Format:

> **Recommended next**
>
> 1. **PG-XX — Title** — reason
> 2. **PG-YY — Title** — reason

### 7. Offer to start

Ask: "Want me to start one of these? I can run `/start <ID>` for you."
