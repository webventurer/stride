# Commit workflow

<mark>**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any step.**</mark>

---

## Execution sequence

| Pass | Action | Goal |
|:-----|:-------|:-----|
| 0 | **Pre-flight** | Fix formatting, identify atomic changes |
| 1 | **Content** | Stage selectively, verify one logical change |
| 2 | **Standards** | Verify message format against checklists |
| 3 | **Final review** | Sanity check before committing |
| 4 | **Post-commit** | Verify atomicity after committing |

---

## Before you start

Read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) first — it contains the coherence test, AI atomicity mistakes, commit format reference, and the pre-commit atomicity trap.

---

## Pass 0: Pre-flight

**Goal**: Clean slate before staging.

### Step 1: Run formatting

<mark>**Run the formatter first. Every time. No exceptions.** If the pre-commit hook finds anything to fix, it changes the working tree but not the staged copy — leaving an orphaned diff after every commit.</mark>

| If this exists | Language | Formatter/linter | Run |
|:---------------|:---------|:------------------|:----|
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Python | Ruff (via pre-commit) | `pre-commit run --all-files` |
| `package.json` with `fix` script | JS/TS | Biome (via pnpm) | `pnpm fix` |

<mark>**Use `pnpm fix`, not `npx lefthook run pre-commit`.**</mark> Lefthook only formats staged files — running it before staging is a no-op, and running it after staging defeats the purpose (the pre-commit hook does the same thing). `pnpm fix` formats all files regardless of staging state, so running it first ensures the hook has nothing left to change. A mixed repo (Python + JS) will have `pre-commit` *and* `pnpm fix` — run both. If none exist, skip — hooks will run during `git commit`.

### Step 2: See what changed

Run `git status` to see all changed files and `git diff` to understand the changes.

### Step 3: Per-file independence gate

<mark>**If 2+ files are changed, STOP. Write one sentence per file before doing anything else:**</mark>

```text
[file] → [what it does independently]
[file] → [what it does independently]
```

**Show these sentences in your output.** Then read them back: if a sentence is incomplete without another file, they belong together. If every sentence stands alone, each is a separate commit. **Do not proceed to Pass 1 until the sentences are written and the grouping decision follows from them — not from session context, not from shared topic, not from "they were changed together".**

For large changesets (10+ files), group by directory or purpose first, then apply the per-file check within each group. The point is to evaluate independence before grouping — not to write 100 sentences.

**Files that belong together** — the test is incomplete without the implementation:

```text
login.ts       → Adds JWT validation to the login flow
login.test.ts  → Tests the new JWT validation
```

**Files that don't** — each sentence stands alone:

```text
meta-cognitive-framework.md  → Fixes link paths to use .claude/docs/ prefix
check_markdown_links.py      → Excludes hooks directories from link checking
```

This prevents concept-level grouping ("they're both about X") from overriding file-level independence. Write the sentences first, then let the sentences decide.

### Step 3b: Shared-file bleed check

<mark>**If a file appears in multiple commit groups, it contains two concerns. Do not commit the whole file with either group.**</mark>

After grouping, scan for files that serve more than one commit. Common examples:

- `pyproject.toml` with two new entry points for two different features
- A shared utility file with additions for different features (e.g. sync `send` for one commit, async `send_async` for another)
- A config file touched by both a feature and an unrelated fix

**When you find a shared file**, use one of these strategies:

| Strategy | When to use |
|:---------|:------------|
| **Temporary edit** | Remove the lines for the later commit, stage, commit, then restore them for the next commit |
| **`git add -p`** | When changes are in separate hunks that git can split cleanly |

**Example**: `openrouter_cli.py` has both `send` (chat commit) and `send_async` (parallelisation commit). Temporarily remove `send_async`, commit the sync version, then add it back for the parallelisation commit.

**The test**: after staging, does `git diff --cached` show only changes for *this* commit's concern? If it shows changes for another commit's concern, you have bleed.

When no file appears in multiple commit groups, report **"No shared-file bleed"** and move on.

### Step 4: Count the commits

Ask: could any subset of these changes be reverted independently and still make sense?

| Signal | Action |
|:-------|:-------|
| All changes serve one purpose | Proceed as one commit |
| Changes serve different purposes | Separate into multiple commits |
| Bug fix + unrelated feature | Two commits |
| Code change + unrelated formatting | Two commits |

Check the [common AI atomicity mistakes](SKILL.md#common-ai-atomicity-mistakes) — do not group changes just because they were made in the same session, share a prefix, or touch the same area.

**Common multi-change scenarios**:

- Bug fix + unrelated feature improvement
- Documentation updates + code changes
- Refactoring + new functionality
- Multiple unrelated bug fixes
- New file creation + existing file modifications for different purposes

---

## Pass 1: Content

**Goal**: Stage the right files for one atomic change.

1. **Stage selectively** — `git add` specific files, not `git add -A`
2. **Review staged changes** — `git diff --cached`
3. **Verify completeness** — are all files needed for this change staged?
4. **Apply the [coherence test](SKILL.md#the-coherence-test)** — does removing any file leave a hole?

### Staging techniques

**Stage specific files**:

```bash
git add file1.js file2.js
```

**Stage partial file changes** (when one file contains changes for multiple commits):

```bash
git add -p filename.js
# Select which hunks belong to each atomic change
```

---

## Pass 2: Standards

**Goal**: Draft the commit message and verify formatting against [SKILL.md](SKILL.md#commit-message-format).

This is a dedicated pass because of [content focus blindness](SKILL.md#content-focus-blindness) — both people and AI miss formatting rules while focused on content logic.

### Intent before diff

<mark>**Before looking at the diff, ask: "What is the user trying to accomplish?"**</mark>

The diff tells you *what changed*. The user's intent tells you *why*. The commit message should reflect the purpose, not the mechanics.

| Trap | Example | Fix |
|:-----|:--------|:----|
| Describing the diff | "Fix image paths" | The purpose was "Add PDF export" — the path fix was just a means |
| Describing the last step | "Rename directory to hyphens" | The purpose was "Embed images in PDF" — the rename enabled it |
| Describing the tool | "Run md2pdf script" | The purpose was "Generate shareable PDF of event notes" |

**The test:** if someone reads only the commit log six months from now, will they understand what was accomplished — or just what files moved?

### Subject line checklist (50 chars max)

- [ ] **No "and" in the subject** — if present, split into separate commits ([the "and" test](SKILL.md#the-and-test)) — **AI frequently misses this**
- [ ] **Standard prefix used** (feat:, docs:, fix:, refactor:, style:, test:, build:, etc.) — **AI frequently misses this**
- [ ] **Subject capitalized after colon** ("feat: Add feature" not "feat: add feature")
- [ ] **Imperative mood** ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
- [ ] **Under 50 characters** total length
- [ ] **No period at end** of subject line
- [ ] **Completes**: "If applied, this commit will [your subject]"

### Body and content checklist (72 chars per line)

- [ ] **Blank line after subject** line
- [ ] **Wrap at 72 characters** maximum per line
- [ ] **Explains WHY** not just what changed
- [ ] **Start with explanatory paragraph** before bullet points
- [ ] **Use bullet points for lists** of changes
- [ ] **One atomic change** (can be reverted independently)
- [ ] **Add warmth** — show care for users and future developers

### Commit execution

<mark>**Never use `git commit` directly — it is blocked by a PreToolUse hook.** Use the wrapper script instead.</mark>

Use multiple `-m` flags to avoid heredoc issues with special characters:

```bash
.claude/stride/hooks/do_commit.sh -m "type: Subject line here" -m "Explanatory paragraph about
why this change was needed. Keep lines under
72 characters.

- Specific change one
- Specific change two"
```

### Pre-commit hook failures

If the commit fails because hooks fix files:

1. Review what the hooks changed
2. Stage the hook-fixed files **only if they belong to this atomic change**
3. If hooks fixed unrelated files, commit your atomic change first, then handle hook fixes separately (see [the pre-commit atomicity trap](SKILL.md#the-pre-commit-atomicity-trap))
4. Re-run the commit

---

## Pass 3: Final review

**Goal**: Last sanity check before the commit lands.

- [ ] Does this commit represent one complete idea?
- [ ] Do all tests pass?
- [ ] Re-read the commit message — does it tell a complete story?
- [ ] Check the diff one more time — are all changes intentional?
- [ ] Can this be reverted independently?
- [ ] Is anything missing?
- [ ] Would this make sense to someone reviewing it in 6 months?

This is the crucial last moment to catch anything that slipped through while focused on content (Pass 1) and formatting (Pass 2).

If any check fails, go back to Pass 1 or Pass 2 as needed.

---

## Pass 4: Post-commit verification

**Goal**: Verify the commit is truly atomic after it lands.

```bash
git diff --stat HEAD~1 HEAD
git log -1
```

- [ ] All files serve the single purpose described in the commit message
- [ ] No hitchhikers — could any file be removed and still leave a coherent change?
- [ ] No stowaways — are there files that serve a different purpose?
- [ ] Clean revert — if reverted, would it remove exactly one logical improvement?

### If verification fails

```bash
# Undo the commit but keep all changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Unstage everything
git reset HEAD .

# Now re-stage and commit each logical change separately
git add <files-for-change-1>
.claude/stride/hooks/do_commit.sh -m "prefix: First logical change"

git add <files-for-change-2>
.claude/stride/hooks/do_commit.sh -m "prefix: Second logical change"
```

### Folding mistakes

If a commit has a small error (typo, missed file) that belongs to the same logical change:

```bash
git add .
.claude/stride/hooks/do_commit.sh --amend --no-edit
```

Only use `--amend` for unpushed commits.

### Pass 4b: Session coherence check

<mark>**If 2+ commits were made this session**, review them as a set before moving on.</mark>

```bash
# Show all session commits with their files
for hash in $(git log --oneline --since="today" --format="%h"); do
  echo "--- $(git log -1 --format='%h %s' $hash) ---"
  git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r "$hash"
  echo
done
```

- [ ] Does each commit's file list match its message?
- [ ] Could any file move between commits and improve coherence?
- [ ] Do the commits tell a clear story reading the log forward?
- [ ] Does any commit message contain "and"? If so, it may be two commits wearing a trench coat — the [and test](SKILL.md#the-and-test) is easier to spot in hindsight than during drafting

**What this catches that Pass 4 doesn't:** Pass 4 checks one commit in isolation. Pass 4b checks whether files landed in the *right* commit. A file that belongs to commit B but ended up in commit A passes Pass 4 (both commits are internally coherent) but fails Pass 4b (the narrative is wrong).

**Example:** Adding ShellCheck to pre-commit requires the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` change *and* the violation fixes in the same commit — config without fixes breaks pre-commit. If the config ended up in an earlier unrelated commit, Pass 4 wouldn't catch it, but Pass 4b would.

## Output

After a successful commit, display the result:

```bash
git log -1 --format="%h %s%n%n%b"
```

<mark>**Always show the FULL commit message — subject AND body.** Do not truncate to just the subject line. The body contains the reasoning (the WHY) which is the most valuable part of the commit.</mark>

Format:

```text
Committed:

<hash> <subject-line>

<full-commit-body including the explanatory paragraph and bullet points>
```

**Bad** — truncating to subject only:
```text
Committed:

995f948 feat: Add create-website skill
```

**Good** — full message:
```text
Committed:

995f948 feat: Add create-website skill

## Verification gate

<mark>**All four passes must complete before the commit is final.**</mark>

- [ ] Pre-flight: formatting fixed, atomic changes identified
- [ ] Content: files staged selectively, coherence test passed
- [ ] Standards: message format verified against checklists
- [ ] Final review: sanity check passed
- [ ] Post-commit: atomicity verified, output displayed
- [ ] Session coherence: if 2+ commits this session, reviewed as a set
