# Getting started

<mark>Vibe coding builds on quicksand. The first few stories go up fast, but a few changes later the house is tipping over and you can't tell which wall is load-bearing.</mark>

Vibe coding is great on day one — you describe what you want, the agent builds it, and within minutes you have a running app. But by day ten you can't tell which change broke things. By day thirty you're afraid to touch anything. By day ninety you're rewriting from scratch.

codefu-core gives you a **solid foundation from the start**. Three Claude Code skills that turn you from a vibe coder into an **agentic engineer** — a [Linear](https://linear.app) workflow that structures *what the agent works on*, atomic commits that structure *how it records each change*, and prompt generation that structures *how it thinks before starting*. All without leaving the terminal.

## Why atomic commits matter

When AI agents write code, the quality of git history becomes a make-or-break concern.

Agents can produce large volumes of changes in a single session. Without discipline, those changes land as **monolithic commits** — impossible to review, difficult to revert, and dangerous to bisect. Atomic commits solve this by ensuring every commit contains *exactly one complete logical change*.

The `/commit` skill encodes a **four-pass methodology** that separates content decisions from formatting standards. It catches the specific atomicity mistakes that AI agents make — grouping by session, by shared prefix, or by proximity rather than by purpose. Each commit becomes independently revertible, clearly explained, and safe to ship.

## Linear integration

*Issues flow from Backlog through Doing to Done, driven entirely by `/linear` commands.*

The `/linear` commands connect your development workflow directly to [Linear](https://linear.app). This is an opinionated choice — Linear is keyboard-driven, git-integrated, and built for the way modern software teams actually work. No drag-and-drop boards, no workflow bloat.

Rather than context-switching between your editor and a browser, you can plan work, create issues, implement features, handle PR feedback, and close issues — all from within Claude Code. The five commands cover the **full development lifecycle**: from researching a problem and writing a well-structured issue, through to merging an approved pull request and marking it done.

This keeps the agent *grounded in real project priorities* rather than working in isolation.

## The loop

The three skills aren't independent — they're stages in the same loop, and each one makes the next one better.

1. **`/craft`** sharpens the problem — structured prompt generation that turns a vague idea into a clear description *before* the agent starts work
2. **`/linear`** turns that description into a tracked issue, then manages the full lifecycle — branching, implementation, PR, review, merge
3. **`/commit`** is called at every commit point within `/linear` to keep the git history atomic — one complete logical change per commit, independently revertible

Remove any piece and the loop still works, but the output gets worse. Without `/craft`, the agent works from whatever you typed. Without `/commit`, the agent dumps everything into monolithic commits. Without `/linear`, the agent works in isolation with no connection to project priorities.

> "When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, **take the path that makes future change easier**." — David Thomas & Andrew Hunt, *The Pragmatic Programmer*

Vibe coding produces code. [Agentic engineering](/reference/agentic-engineering) produces **a traceable, reversible, purposeful history of decisions** — every change is atomic, every change is tied to an objective, and the agent operates with the discipline of a senior engineer rather than the enthusiasm of an intern with root access.

The approach is designed to compound: as AI models improve, the structured documentation gets more from them, not less.

## App starters

codefu-core gives you the engineering workflow. App starters give you the project scaffold. Each starter is an opinionated template that gets you from zero to a working app in one command — with codefu-core's skills already wired in.

### [app-starter](https://github.com/webventurer/app-starter)

A modern full-stack web app starter — React + TypeScript + Vite on the frontend, Hono + Neon + Clerk + Drizzle on the backend. Every layer is independently replaceable — swap one piece without rewiring the rest. Includes shadcn/ui for components, Biome for formatting, and reference docs that explain every technology choice.

```bash
gh repo clone webventurer/app-starter
./app-starter/scripts/create.sh my-app
```
