# Install

```bash
npx github:webventurer/stride
```

This copies skills, commands, hooks, and tools into your project's `.claude/` directory and merges hook config into your `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored, machine-local).

## Uninstall

```bash
npx -p github:webventurer/stride stride-uninstall
```

This removes all copied directories, the example file, and strips the stride hook from `.claude/settings.local.json`. Your `.mcp.json` is left untouched — remove Linear servers manually if needed.

## Requirements

### Claude Code

Install the [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Linear MCP server

The `/linear` commands need Linear's [official MCP server](https://linear.app/docs/mcp). There are two ways to connect — **OAuth** (simplest) or **API key** (needed for multiple orgs).

Copy `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json` and choose your approach:

#### OAuth (single org)

Uses browser-based login — no keys to manage:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On first use, a browser window opens to authenticate. The token is cached locally.

#### API key (multiple orgs)

When you need separate connections to different Linear orgs — add one entry per org with its own API key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear-org1": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:Bearer ${LINEAR_ORG1_API_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_ORG1_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_ORG1_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "linear-org2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:Bearer ${LINEAR_ORG2_API_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_ORG2_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_ORG2_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry points to the same `mcp.linear.app/mcp` endpoint but authenticates with a different key. Add the keys to your `~/.env`:

```
LINEAR_ORG1_API_KEY=lin_api_...
LINEAR_ORG2_API_KEY=lin_api_...
```

Get your API keys at [linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api) — one per org. Replace `org1`/`org2` with meaningful names (e.g. `LINEAR_ACME_API_KEY`).

#### Verify the connection

```
/linear:check
```

This confirms that each configured Linear server responds and shows which workspace it's connected to.

### GitHub CLI

Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) for PR operations:

```bash
brew install gh                # macOS
# or: https://cli.github.com/ for other platforms
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
gh auth login
```

## Python tools

The cross-model feedback loop in `/linear:plan-work` uses a Python script to send drafts to ChatGPT via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). Dependencies are managed inline with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — no venv or `pip install` needed.

```bash
brew install uv                # macOS
# or: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Add your OpenRouter API key to `~/.env`:

```
OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

Get your key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).

## What gets installed

```bash
.claude/stride/
├── skills/commit/           # skill + workflow + reference docs
├── skills/craft/            # CRAFT prompt skill
├── commands/linear/         # 5 commands + reference docs
├── hooks/                   # commit wrapper + bare-commit blocker
├── docs/                    # supporting patterns and concepts
└── tools/                   # cross-model feedback script
```

Everything lives under `.claude/stride/` — add one line to your `.gitignore` and never touch it again. Hook config goes into `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) — your committed `settings.json` is never modified. Claude Code concatenates hooks from both files, so repo hooks and stride hooks run together.

## Migration skills

Two skills for migrating issues between workspaces live on the [`migrate` branch](/reference/migration-skills). They require Python and are kept separate to keep the main install lightweight.

```bash
git checkout migrate
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
make install
```

This gives you `/linear-to-linear` (copy between Linear workspaces) and `/trello-to-linear` (migrate from Trello). See the [migration skills reference](/reference/migration-skills) for full details.

Switch back when done: `git checkout main`

## Known limitations

### No versioning

There's no version number, changelog, or upgrade path. When you install, you get the current state of the repo. If you install again later, files are overwritten with whatever's current — no diff, no migration notes.

**What this means:** you won't know what changed between installs. If the repo goes private or gets renamed, your project still works (the files are local), but updates stop with no warning.

**Workaround:** pin to a specific commit if stability matters:

```bash
npx github:webventurer/stride#<commit-sha>
```

### Hook scripts require bash

The commit safety hook (`block_bare_git_commit.sh`) is a shell script. If it fails — wrong shell, missing permissions, Windows without WSL — the enforcement disappears silently. The agent will happily use bare `git commit` without the four-pass methodology.

**Check it's working:** if you can run `.claude/stride/hooks/do_commit.sh --help` without errors, you're fine. If not, check that the scripts are executable (`chmod +x .claude/stride/hooks/*.sh`).

### Settings merge strategy

Hook config is written to `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored), not `settings.json`. This keeps your committed settings untouched — see [decision 001](decisions/001-hooks-in-settings-local.md) for rationale.

The merge uses a deep strategy on `settings.local.json`:

- **Objects** are merged recursively — your keys are preserved, stride's keys are added alongside
- **Arrays** (like hook lists) are appended with deduplication — if a hook already exists, it's skipped
- **Scalar values** — stride's value wins if both sides set the same key

Claude Code concatenates hook arrays from both `settings.json` and `settings.local.json`, so your repo's committed hooks and stride's installed hooks all run together.
